# WikiMeet
WikiMeet is a game that wraps around the traditional "Wikipedia Game" where users start on a random wikipedia page and must traverse to a designated target.

WikiMeet runs off of NodeJS and requires it to be installed on your computer prior to being started.

Two projects exist within this respository, the primary application and the route database microservice which controls all DB access for managing routes and links found.

To run the application, navigate to WikiMeet and run the commands:
> npm install
> node app.js

And then go to WikiMeetRouteService and run the same commands.
The main server will be at:
http://localhost:5000
